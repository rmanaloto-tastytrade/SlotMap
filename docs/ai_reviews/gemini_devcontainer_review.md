# Gemini Review: Devcontainer Toolchain Isolation

Attempted to run `gemini prompt "..."` with the review request. The CLI returned no output (after loading cached credentials) and did not produce a review. Treat this as "no usable response".

Next action: rerun Gemini with explicit file content via stdin if/when the CLI is responsive, and capture the output.
