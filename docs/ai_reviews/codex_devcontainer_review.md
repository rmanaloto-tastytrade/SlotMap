# Codex Review: Devcontainer Toolchain Isolation

Attempted to run `codex exec` with embedded file contents for Dockerfile/devcontainer.json/verify_devcontainer.sh. The Codex CLI session became exploratory and did not return a clean, actionable review output (no concise findings were produced). Treat this as "no usable response" for now.

Next action: rerun Codex with a simplified `codex exec` prompt or via Codex MCP if available, ensuring file contents are passed explicitly and capturing only the final summary.
