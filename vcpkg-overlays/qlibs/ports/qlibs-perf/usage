qlibs-perf provides CMake targets:

    find_package(qlibs-perf CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE qlibs::perf)

Then include in your source files:

    #include <qlibs/perf>

Note: Full functionality requires Linux with perf-event-open support and optionally LLVM.
For basic timing (rdtsc/chrono), no additional dependencies are needed.
